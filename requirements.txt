# Core data handling and computation
pandas              # For data manipulation and analysis
numpy               # For numerical operations and array handling

# Machine Learning libraries
scikit-learn        # For ML models, evaluation metrics, train-test splits
xgboost             # Gradient boosting model (used as standalone and meta-learner)
lightgbm            # Lightweight gradient boosting for structured data
catboost            # Boosting algorithm optimized for categorical features

# Deep Learning
tensorflow          # Used for building MLP, LSTM, CNN, AutoEncoder, etc.

# Visualization (optional but helpful)
matplotlib          # For plotting evaluation graphs and metrics
seaborn             # For visualizing confusion matrices, feature importances

# If working in Jupyter Notebook
notebook            # Ensures Jupyter compatibility (optional)
